# Solenya

Solenya is the web framework for you if you like **conceptual simplicity**. The heart of a solenya application is **your object model**. The solenya API lets you easily translate your object model to the DOM, the cloud, and local storage.  

![solenya flow diagram](solenya-architecture.png "Solenya Flow Diagram")

To manage complexity in a web application, we split it into modular chunks. It's helpful to think of common types of chunks, or "components", in terms of their statefulness:

1) Objects with application state (i.e. a high level chunk of an application).
2) Pure functions that return a view (i.e. a stateless virtual dom node)
3) Objects with DOM state (i.e. essentially a web component)
 
Most web frameworks today focus on building components of type '2' and '3', but have a "figure it out yourself" stance when it comes to '1'. This lack of native support for type 1 components causes serious problems.

The immediate strategy, which is really a lack of strategy, or upside-down strategy, is to use a type '3' component, an abstraction around an HTML DOM element, and then polute it with application logic. In code samples, and in small applications, we can get away with this dirty ad-hoc approach, but the approach doesn't scale.

For this reason, many people eventually adopt the strategy of using a separate state management library. The problem here is that your type 1 component is fractured: there's the state management parts, the view parts, and then some boilerplate to connect the parts. Aside from being unpleasantly verbose, this hampers reusability.

Solenya is designed for building high-level type '1' components. This means you can cleanly organise your application into meaningful, reusable, high-level chunks. So for example, you could have a component for a login, a component for a paged table, or a component for an address. And you can compose components to any scale: in fact your root component will represent your entire application.

Each component's view is a pure function of its state, so within each component we get a high degree of separation of the application logic/state and the view. In fact, for any solenya application, you can strip out its views, and the core structure of the application remains in tact. Writing a component means thinking about its state and state transitions first, and its views second. This approach makes solenya components innately serializable. So another way to think about solenya components is that they represent the serializable parts of your application, that you might want to load and save from and to local storage or the server. Anyway, time to see some code.

# First Code Sample

Here's a counter component in solenya:

```typescript
export class Counter extends Component
{
    count = 0

    view () {
        return div (
            button ({ onclick: () => this.add (1) }, "+"),
            this.count
        )
    }

    add (x: number) {
        this.update(() => this.count += x) 
    }
}
```
[Play](https://stackblitz.com/edit/solenya-samples?file=app%2Fcounter.ts)

In solenya, application state lives in your components â€” in this case `count`.

Components can optionally implement a `view` method, which is a pure non side effecting function of the component's state. Views are rendered with a virtual DOM, such that the real DOM is efficiently patched with only the changes since the last update.

Components update their state exclusively via the their `update` method, which will automatically refresh the view. It really is that simple. In fact, simplicity is the defining characteristic of solenya.

# Comparison Table

Solenya simplifies many aspects of writing a web application.

| What | Simple Way | Complicated Way |
|-|-|-|
| State Management | Intrinsic to design | Separate state manager library w/ tons of boilerplate
| Type Checking | Just use Typescript. Implicit testing, great tooling, and eased refactoring | Extra testing & tooling to compensate for not using static typing, and painful refactoring 
| Rendering HTML | Just use typescript. No templating language required. You don't need a templating language if your programming language is expressive | Yet another templating language, with ad-hoc constructs reinventing language features for looping, conditionals, etc. lacking the consistency and generality of an actual programmming language. The root of the problem: embedding a programming language in structureless strings is inherently more complex than embedding structureless strings in a programming language.
| CSS | Just use typescript. Style with `typestyle`. (Yes, you can also still easily reference ordinary css.) | Unmanageable stylesheets, where you can't easily rename, refactor, parameterize, etc. The root of the problem is your styles are expressed in a language that's simplistic and excessively decoupled from your view.
| Paradigm | Use both functional and OO, using pure functions rather than side-effecting functions where possible | Only use the functional approach, even if it means turning walking into gymanastics. Reducers, higher-order-components, functional lensing, boilerplate 
| Updating the DOM | Output a virtual DOM tree as a pure function of your object model | Manually manipulate the DOM on a case-by-case basis
| Serialization | Intrinsic to design. Time travel debugging, hot module reloading, transactions, undo/redo all use the same single mechanism | Separate serialization library w/ bridge code to components
| Async | Call any async function, then update component state synchronously | Either force synchronous actions where asynchronous actions are required, or force asynchronous actions when synchronous actions suffice (the latter is characteristic of functional reactive programming frameworks). |
| Configuration | None | Custom file types, global configuration settings |

# Integration with Existing Libraries

Solenya is small: see and understand the source code for yourself. Its power comes from its simplicity, and its integration as well as intended use with many other great libraries:

 * A virtual DOM based on Ultradom *(forked)*
 * typestyle *(dependency)*
 * typescript & reflect-metadata for reflection *(dependency)*
 * class-tranformer for serialization *(dependency)*
 * class-validator is used by solenya validation *(dependency)*

# State, View and Updates

A solenya app outputs a virtual DOM node as a pure function of its state. On each update, the previous root virtual DOM node is compared with the new one, and the actual DOM is efficiently patched with the change. DOM events can trigger updates, which result in a view refresh, forming a cyclic relationship between the state and the view.

Components help you factor your app into reusable parts, or parts with separate concerns. An app has a reference to your root component.

Components are designed to be serializable. When autosave or time travel is on, your component tree is serialized on each update. This provides a unified approach to time travel debugging, hot module reloading, transactions, and undo/redo. Serialization is covered in more detail in the serialization section.

![solenya flow diagram](solenya-flow-diagram.png "Solenya Flow Diagram")

This flow diagram represents updating a GrandChild2 component. In this case, we have a very simple application, where the view tree mirrors the component tree. As an application gets larger, the view tree will typically only represent a subset of the component tree. For example, in an application with wizard steps, the component tree would probably have *every* wizard step, while the view tree would only have the *current* wizard step. 

# Composition

Composition is straightforward with `solenya`, allowing you to factor your application into a tree of smaller components:

```typescript
export class TwinCounters extends Component
{
    counter1 = new Counter ()
    counter2 = new Counter ()

    view () {
        return div (
            this.counter1.view (),
            this.counter2.view ()
        )
    }
}
```
[Play](https://stackblitz.com/edit/solenya-samples?file=app%2Fcomposition.ts)

Components must have parameterless constructors, though they may include *optional* arguments. This small design restriction enables `class-transformer`'s deserializer to work.

Child components should be created in the constructors, field initialisers, and updates of their parents.

You can specific arrays of components, recursive components, or even arrays of recursive components. Here's from one of the samples. The type annotation is required to allow deserialization to work for arrays, as typescript erases the type of the property after compilation.

```typescript
export class Tree extends Component
{    
    @Type (() => Tree) trees: Tree[] = []
    ...
}
```
[Play](https://stackblitz.com/edit/solenya-samples?file=app%2Ftree.ts)

# Component Initialization

You component's life begins with a constructor call. As described later, the deserializer will still call your constructor, but then set the object's properties. That's why your constructor's arguments must be optional.

When your app is first created or deserialized, and after every update, a depth-first traversal occurs, where `attached` is called on every component not already attached:

```typescript
   attached (deserialised: boolean) {
       ...
   }
```
On the traversal, child components are identified by being properties or property array elements of the parent. As such each child will get attached, and have its `parent` and `app` properties set (except the root component which obviously has an undefined `parent`). This enables updates to a child to bubble up to the root component.

# Updates

After app startup or deserialization, all state transitions must occur within an update.

An update is straightforward:

```typescript
    add (x: number) {
        this.update(() => this.count += x) 
    }
```
You pass `update` a void function that performs a state transition.

At the end of an update, the root component's `view` method is called. Updates are synchronous, but views are refreshed asynchronously.

Nested updates are regarded as a single update. The view will at most be called once for an update.

In more advanced scenarios you can capture updates, as explained later in the child-to-parent-communication section.

# Views

Views are pure functions of state. Solenya uses a virtual DOM (forked from Ultradom) to efficiently update the actual DOM.

You can add as may optional parameters as you want to your child component `View` methods. This makes it easy for parents to customize their children without their children needing extra state:

```typescript
    view () {
        return div (
            this.child1.view (...),
            this.child2.view (...)
        )
    }
```
`view` methods return the type `VElement`. However, your component might be faceless, having no view implementation, or might have several methods returning different `VElement` objects. This is because solenya components are state-centric, not view-centric.

To write a reusable view, your first approach should be to merely write a function that returns a `VElement`. Only use child components when you need to encapsulate state.

# HTML Helpers

The HTML helpers take a spread of attribute objects, elements, and primitive values. Solenya has been designed to work well with Typescript, so your IDE can provide statement completion. In conjunction with `typestyle`, as we'll see later, we get a deep, clean static typing experience.

Attribute objects go first. Some examples:

```typescript
div ()                                  // empty
div ("hello")                           // primitive value
div ({id: 1})                           // attribute
div ({id: 1, class: "foo"})             // multiple attributes
div ({id: 1}, "hello")                  // attribute followed by element
div (div ())                            // nested elements
div ({id: 1}, "hello", div("goodbye"))  // combination
```
Multiple attribute objects are merged. Merging attributes is really useful when writing functions allowing the caller to merge their own attributes in with yours. The following are equivalent:

```typescript
div ({id: 1}, {class:"foo"})
div ({id: 1, class:"foo"})  
```

All the HTML element helper functions such as `div` and `span`, call through to the `h` function. The `h` function merges multiple attribute objects using the `mergeAttrs` method, which you can also directly call yourself.

Event handlers are specified as simply a name followed by the handler:
```
button (
    { onclick: () => this.add (1) }, "+"
)
```

# Style

While you can use ordinary css or scss files with solenya, solenya has first class support for [typestyle](https://github.com/typestyle/typestyle), that lets you write css in typescript.

The key advantages are:

* Typescript is far more powerful than any stylesheet language - it's a better way to organize and abstract your styles.
* It eliminates the seam between your view functions and styles - easily pass in variables to dynamically create styles.
* You can colocate your code with your styles, or provide exactly the appropriate level of coupling to maximise maintainability.

Here's what it looks like:

```typescript
div ({style: {color:'green' }}, 'solenya')
```
Solenya will call typestyle's `style` function on the object you provide. It's as if you called:

```typescript
div ({class: style ({color:'green'})}, 'solenya')
```
If you need to reuse a style, then don't inline the style: declare it as a variable and refer to it in your class attribute. You can factor it just as you please.

Typestyle will dynamically create a small unique class name, and add css to the top of your page. So the following:

```typescript
div ({style: {color: 'green'} },
    "solenya"
)
```
Which will generate something like:

```html
<div class="fdwf33">
    solenya
</div>
```
With the following css:
```css
fdwf33 {
    style: green;
}
```
Solenya automatically merges css values. The following are equivalent:

```typescript
div ({class: "big"}, {class: "happy"})
div ({class: "big happy"})
```

You may also use ordinary style strings rather than objects, which bypasses the typestyle library.

## Important Gotcha

Since style objects are actually converted into classes, they may not override other styles in other classes that apply to that element. If this is a issue either add the `!important` modifier to the style, or revert to a string style. You should however discover that with typestyle you have less need to use the `!important` modifier in the first place as you can better abstract your styles.

# Forms

To make writing forms easier, solenya provides some widget functions for common inputs. You can easily build your own ones by examining the widgets source code.

* `inputText` : text input
* `inputNumber` : numeric input
* `inputValue` : restricted input - use to make custom inputs such as `percentInput` or `currencyInput`
* `inputTextArea` : text area input
* `inputRange` : numeric range input
* `selector` : select input
* `radioGroup` : group of labelled radio buttons
* `checkbox` : labelled checkbox

The input functions are css agnostic - you can precisely control an input's attributes and nested element attributes. This enables you to write your own wrapper functions around these functions to target a particular css framework with your particular style. You then only need change the internals of your wrapper functions for all your forms code across your entire application to target completely different css.

In this example, we write a BMI component with two sliders:

```typescript
export class BMI extends Component
{
    height = 180
    weight = 80

    calc () {
        return this.weight / (this.height * this.height / 10000)
    }

    view () : VElement {       
        return div (             
            div (
                "height",
                inputRange ({target: this, prop: () => this.height, attrs: { min: 100, max: 250, step: 1 } }),
                this.height
            ),
            div (
                "weight",
                inputRange ({target: this, prop: () => this.weight, attrs: { min: 100, max: 250, step: 1 } })
                this.weight
            ),
            div ("bmi: " + this.calc())
        )
    }
}
```
[Play](https://stackblitz.com/edit/solenya-samples?file=app%2Fbmi.ts)

All inputs are databound, and all take a single parameter. That parameter always inherits from the base class `InputProps<T>`:

```typescript
export interface InputProps<T> { // T is the data type to bind to (e.g. a number)
    target: Component, // component to bind to
    prop: PropertyRef<T>, // target property, e.g. () => this.weight
    attrs?: HAttributes // the attributes for the input
}
```
The `target` and `prop` properties reference a component's property, enabling the input to be databound to that property. The `PropertyRef<T>` type can either take a function that refers to a property, such as `() => this.weight` or a ordinary string, e.g. `weight`. The former (statically typed) should be used when you know the property at compile time, and the latter (dynamically typed) should be used when you only know the property at runtime.

Minimially, all inputs will have an optional `attrs` type. More complex input types have many other properties. Some of these properties specify nested attribues. You can use the `mergeAttrs` and `mergeNestedAttrs` helper functions to merge attributes. `mergeNestedAttrs` takes several objects, scans for properties on those objects whose name ends with `attrs`, and then calls through to `mergeAttrs` to merge those attributes and styles. This makes it much easier to write reusable and chainable helper functions.

In the above example, there's clearly boilerplate. In the next section, you'll notice you can easily write your own `inputUnit` higher-level function that generalizes the concept of an input with a label and validation.

## Validation

The solenya library comes with a validator.

The solenya validator builds on the excellent `class-validator` library to validate with javascript decorators. Here's an example of validating some properties on a component:

```typescript
export class ValidationSample extends MyForm implements IValidated
{     
    @transient validator: Validator = new Validator (this)
    
    @Label("Your User Name") @MinLength(3) @MaxLength(10) @IsNotEmpty()  username?: string
    @Min(0) @Max(10)                                                     rating? number
    @IsNumber()                                                          bonus? number

    ok() {
        this.validator.validateThenUpdate()
    }

    updated (payload: any) {
        if (this.validator.wasValidated)
            this.validator.validateThenUpdate (payload)  
    }

    view () : VElement {           
        return div (  
            inputUnit (this, () => this.username, props => inputText (props)),
            inputUnit (this, () => this.rating, props => inputNumber (props),
            inputUnit (this, () => this.bonus, props => inputCurrency (props)),
            div (
                myButton ({ onclick: () => this.ok() }, "ok")
            )
        )       
    }
}
```
[Play](https://stackblitz.com/edit/solenya-samples?file=app%2Fvalidation.ts)

By decorating class properties, you can express constraints, as well as custom labels to be used for display and validation.

When you're ready to validate (in this case because the user clicked 'ok'), you call the `validator`'s `validateThenUpdate` method. This compares the component's properties to the constraints on those properties. When complete, the `validationErrors` property on the `validator` will contain an element for each property with constraint violations.

We use the `component`'s update method to keep validated after we've first validated, to give the user continuous feedback. We can also manually flip `wasValidated` back to false.

Validation works recursively for child components that also implement `IValidated`.

### Asynchronous Validation

Validation can be asynchronous, since you'll sometimes need to call a service to determine validity.

```typescript
class ValidationSample extends Component implements IValidated
{
    async customValidationErrors() {
        ...
    }
}
```
The return type is `Promise<ValidationError[]>`, where `ValidationError` is a a type from the `class-validator` package.

# 'this' Rules

The `this` variable's binding is not as straightforward as in object oriented languages like C# and Java. There's a great article about [this here](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/'this'-in-TypeScript).

Within solenya components, follow the pattern you see in this documentation, which has two rules:

Always wrap a method that's used as a callback in a closure, otherwise `this` might be lost before it's bound.

```typescript
    // RIGHT
    methodUsingYourCallback (e => this.updateProperty (e))
    
    // WRONG
    methodUsingYourCallback (this.updateProperty)
```
Use ordinary class methods, not function members when calling update. Otherwise cloning â€” which solenya relies on for time travel â€” fails, since the cloned function will refer to the old object's this.

```typescript
    // RIGHT
    add () {
       return this.update (...

    // WRONG
    add = () =>
        this.update (...
```

# Routing

The solenya library comes with a composable router.

The samples use routing in two places. First, each sample has it's own route. Second, we use a router so that each tab in the "tabSample" has a nested route. So here's the possible routes:

```
/counter
/bmi
/tabSample/apple
/tabSample/banana
/tabSample/cantaloupe
```

Let's start with the outer router first. 

```
export class Samples extends Component implements IRouted
{
    @transient router:Router = new Router (this)
    @transient routeName = ""

    counter = new Counter ()
    bmi = new BMI ()    
    tabSample = new TabSample ()
    ...
    
    attached()
    {
        for (var k of this.childrenKeys()) {
            this[k].router = new Router(this[k])
            this[k].routeName = k
        }
        ...
    }
}
```
A component can be routed by implementing `IRouted`. A routed component defines a `routeName` property that corresponds to a *name* in a *path*.

So for the path `/tabSample/banana`, there's a component with the `tabSample` `routeName`, which has a child component with the `banana` `routeName`. The root component, `Samples` has an empty string for its routeName.

A *current route* is represented with a component route's `currentChildName` value. So the `currentChildName` of the `Samples` component's router is `tabSamples`, and the `curentChildName` of the `TabSample` component's router is `banana`. Finally, the `currentChildName` of the `banana` component's router is simply ``, since it's a leaf node, i.e. itself has no children.

By default, the mapping from parent and child name to child component occurs by scanning the parent for children and returning one that has a `routeName` that (case insensitively) matches the name provided. For complete control, you could implement the `childRoute` method to customize that default behaviour.

## Navigation

You can call a component router's `navigate` method, specifying the child path to go to. All routes are expressed *relatively*, not *absolutely*. In the examples below, we navigate to `banana`:

```
// when navigating from 'banana':
this.router.navigate ('')

// when navigating from 'tabSample':
this.router.navigate ('banana')

// when navigating from 'apple', via the parent
this.router.parent.navigate ('banana')

// when navigating from 'apple', via the root
this.router.root.navigate ('tabSample/banana')
```

## Initialisation and Browser History

Your first navigation typically occurs in the `attached` method of your root component. For example:
    
```
export class Samples extends Component implements IRouted {
    attached() {
        ...
        this.router.navigate (location.pathname)
    }
    ...
}
```
The initial call to `navigate` on your root router is special in terms of navigation events:

* History tracking begins
  * This means from then on, actions such as the back and forward button on the browser will trigger navigation events.
  * (The router internally uses the `history` api to update the browser history and to respond to browser navigation events.)
* Navigation callbacks always run
  * The `beforeNavigate` and `navigated` callbacks on your component, if present, will be called even if the current url is identical to the url navigated to.
  * This is because before the initial navigation, it shouldn't be assumed that the application state reflects the current url.

## Intercepting Navigation

We can implement the `navigated` method to detect when a component is routed. We do this in the `Relativity` sample, where we have a continuous animation that we want to trigger when the component is routed:

```typescript
export class Relativity extends Component {
    navigated() {
        ...
    }
}
```

[play](https://stackblitz.com/edit/solenya-samples?file=app%2Frelativity.ts)

`navigated` will be called for each component in the path.

We intercept `navigate` by implementing `beforeNavigate`. It's important to be able to intercept navigation for several reasons:

 * Prevention: We don't want the user to leave the current form until it's validated, or perhaps we want to redirect the user to another route
 * Preparation: We need to fetch data, perhaps asynchronously, before we can complete the navigation.
 * Redirection: We want to redirect the user by canceling the current navigation and navigating to a new path.

In the `TabGroup` component, we use `beforeNavigate` for two purposes. First, we want to redirect to the first nested tab if no tab is selected. Second, we want to animate the tab left or right, depending on whether the new tab's index is less than or greater than its previous index.

```typescript
export abstract class TabGroup extends Component implements IRouted
{
    @transient router: Router = new Router (this)
    @transient routeName!: string   

    attached() {
        for (var k of this.childrenKeys()) {
            this[k].router = new Router (this[k])
            this[k].routeName = k
        }
    } 

    async beforeNavigate (childPath: string) {
        const kids = this.childrenKeys()
        if (childPath == '') {
            this.router.navigate (this.router.currentChildComponent ? this.router.currentChildName : kids[0])
            return false
        }

        this.slideForward = kids.indexOf (childPath) > kids.indexOf (this.router.currentChildName)
        return true
    }
```

We return `false` when we want to cancel a navigation, and `true` when we're happy that the navigation goes ahead. The `beforeNavigate` method works very well in tandum with validation, that we discussed earlier. If your current state isn't valid, it's very common to prevent the navigation occuring by returning `false`.

We can now use `TabGroup` as follows:

```typescript
export class TabSample extends TabGroup
{  
    apple = new MyTabContent ("Apples are delicious")
    banana = new MyTabContent ("But bananas are ok")
    cantaloupe = new MyTabContent ("Cantaloupe that's what I'm talking about.")
}
```

## Navigation Links

For convenience, `router` has a function for generating navigation links. These look like ordinary url links, but they use the `onclick` event to ensure the router's navigation method is called, rather than jumping to a new page:

```typescript
navigateLink (path: string, ...content: HValue[])
```

# Child-To-Parent Communication

Use composition to manage complexity: as your application grows, parent components compose children into larger units of functionality. However, sometimes communication has to go in the reverse direction: from child to parent. This is done in one of three ways:

* Callbacks
* Parent Interface
* Update Path

With all of these approaches, the single-source-of-truth is always maintained. Avoid copying state.

## Callback Communication

With this approach, the parent passes a callback to the child:

```typescript
class ParentComponent extends Component {
    @Type (() => ChildComponent) child: ChildComponent
    view () {
        return (
            ...
            child.view (() => this.updateSomeValue())
            ...
        )
    }    
}

class ChildComponent extends Component {
    ...
    view (updateSomeValue?: () => void) : VElement { 
        ...
    }
}
```
It's worth repeating that you should only use a child component if the child component has its *own* state. If not, save yourself some typing and replace your child component with a function that returns a `VElement`.

### todoMVC

In this sample, we use the callback pattern, both when factoring out a child component (`taskItem`), and factoring out a function that returns a view (`linkListView`):

[Play](https://stackblitz.com/edit/solenya-samples?file=app%2Ftodos.ts)

Note that a small design restriction is that the arguments to `view` must be optional to support the parameterless super class `view`.

## Parent Interface Communication

With this pattern:

1. The parent component implements an interface for exposing only the state your child needs to see
2. The child component has a method that returns this.parent cast to the parent interface

So the code structure is as follows:

```typescript
interface IParent {
    someMethod() : SomeType	
}

class ParentComponent extends Component implements IParent {
    someMethod() { return ... }
    ...
}

class ChildComponent extends Component {
    iparent() { return <IParent>this.parent }
    ...
}
```
The purpose of the interface is to reduce the surface area of the parent that the child can see, so that you can more easily reason about your code.

You may also use the `Component`'s `root()`, or `branch()` API (explained in the API section further below) to target a specific ancestor, rather than the immediate parent.

It's almost always a bad idea to access a sibling component. Instead, the child should access the parent, and the parent should interact with the other child.

We highly recommend you install the `circular-dependency-plugin` package, and run it as part of your build process. Keep your cyclomatic complexity low!

## Update Communication

All state changes to `Component` trigger its `updated` method:

```typescript
   updated (payload: any) {
      ...
   }
```
The `updated` method will be subsequently called on each parent through the root. This allows a parent to respond tp updates made by its children, without having to handle specific callbacks.

The `payload` property contains any data associated with the update. The `source` property will be set to component that `update` was called on, which is occasionally useful.

# Interacting with the DOM

## onRefreshed

You may call `Component.onRefreshed` to queue a callback to perform DOM side effects after the next refresh. You typically do so in the `view` method:

```typescript
   view() {
       this.onRefreshed (() => { ... }) // called after DOM is updated
       return div (...)
   }
```
You may however, need deeper control side-effecting the DOM.

## Lifecycle Events

For the most part, views are pure functions of state. However, DOM elements can have additional state, such as inputs that have focus and selections. Furthermore, animations, at a low level, need to interact with the DOM bypassing the virtual DOM. This is for both performance reasons (as you don't want to invoke the GC), as well as keeping your application state logic separated from your animation state. For example, if you delete an item from a list, it's a simplifying assumption for your application state to consider that item gone, but you'll want that item to live a little longer in the real DOM to gracefully exit.

To interact with the DOM directly, you provide lifecycle callbacks on your virtual DOM elements. The lifecycle callbacks should be familiar to anyone familar with a virtual dom:

```
export interface VLifecycle
{
    onAttached? (el: Element, attrs: VAttributes) : void
    onBeforeUpdate? (el: Element, attrs: VAttributes) : void
    onUpdated? (el: Element, attrs: VAttributes) : void    
    onBeforeRemove? (el: Element) : Promise<void>
    onRemoved? (el: Element) : void
}
```
`onAttached` is called when an element is attached to the DOM.

`onUpdate` is called whenever an element is updated. Use it to perform any final updates to the DOM. The `onBeforeUpdate` lets you take any preliminary actions before the element changes.

`onRemoved` is called when an element is removed from the DOM.`onBeforeRemove` allows you take any preliminary actions - which may be asynchronous - before an element is removed. 

Here's how you might plug in some focusing logic when an element is added to the DOM:

```typescript
 div ({
     onAttached: (el, attrs) => handleFocus (el...)
    ...
```
When the patcher adds an element to the DOM corresponding to your virtual div element, it invokes the `onAttached` callback.

Lifecycle callbacks automatically compose. So both `onAttached` functions will be called here, in the order of appearance:

```typescript
 div (
    {
        onAttached: (el, attrs) => handleFocus (el...)
    },
    {
        onAttached: (el, attrs) => handleSelection (el...)
    }
    ...
 }
```
## DOM Keys

After each update, the virtual DOM is patched. The patcher compares the current virtual DOM tree to the previous one, and modifies the real DOM accordingly. However, the patching algorithm can't know your intent, and so occassionally does the wrong thing. It may try to reuse an element that you definitely want to replace, or it may try to replace a list of child elements that you merely wanted to reorder. To better determine the creation and destruction of DOM nodes, provide *keys* for your virtual DOM nodes. For example:

```typescript
div ({key: wizardPage})
```
If the key changes, the patcher now knows to definitely recreate that DOM element. This means even if your next wizard page happened to have an input that could have been updated, that instead it will be replaced, predictably resetting DOM state like focus and selections, and invoking any animations that should occur on element creation.

## Animating a List

Let's combine the concepts in the previous sections to shuffle an array, where each element gracefully moves to its new position each time the array is updated. We can use lodash's shuffle function to perform the `shuffle`, and our own `slideChildren` function to perform the animation. We'll need to make sure each item in the array has a unique `key`, so that the patcher knows to reuse each child element.

```typescript
export class AnimateListExample extends Component
{
    @transient items = range (1, 20)

    view () {        
        return div(
            myButton ({ onclick: () => this.shuffle () }, "shuffle"),       
            ul (slideChildren(), this.items.map (n => li ({ key: n }, n)))
        )
    }

    shuffle() {
        this.update (() => this.items = shuffle (this.items))
    }
}
```
We can implement `slideChildren` using the [FLIP](https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/) technique:
```typescript
export function slideChildren () : VLifecycle
{
    return {                       
        onBeforeUpdate (el) {                
            let els = el["state_slideChildren"] = Array.from(el.childNodes).map(c => (c as HTMLElement))
            els.forEach (c => measure(c))
        },
        onUpdated (el) {
            let els = el["state_slideChildren"] as HTMLElement[]
            els.forEach (c => flip (c))
        }                    
    } 
}
```

By design, these lifecycle events are not present on solenya components. Solenya components manage application state, only affecting DOM state via its `view` method, and the intentionally ungranular `onRefreshed` method. This lets you separate the very different lifecycles of application state and DOM state, making your code easier to maintain.

While there's always pragmatic exceptions, the principles of solenya state are:

 * Application state belongs on components.
 * DOM state belongs on DOM elements.
 * No state belongs on virtual DOM elements.

# App

To start Solenya, pass the constructor of your top level component into your App instance, with a string defining the id of the element where you app will be hosted. For example:

```typescript
import { App } from 'solenya'

var app = new App (Counter, "app")
```
You can also construct the application from an explicit instance. This can be useful when you've deserialized the component from somewhere else, such as a server. 

```typescript
var app = new App (Counter, "app", {rootComponent: counterFromTheWeb })
```
Make sure you've read the serialization section to ensure your component deserializes correctly.

# Time Travel

Maintaining state history is useful when you want transactions, undo/redo, and time travel debugging.

You can turn time travel on and off on App as follows:

```typescript
app.timeTravelOn = true|false
```
Now all updates will be recorded.

You can now navigate as follows:

```typescript
time.start()  // goto start state
time.end()    // goto end state
time.next()   // goto next state
time.prev()   // goto prev state
time.goto(4)  // goto nth state
```
You can also use a predicate to seek a particular state:
```typescript
time.seek(state => state.counter.count == 7)
```
[Play](https://stackblitz.com/edit/solenya-samples?file=app%2FtimeTravel.ts)

When time travel is on, solenya serializes the component tree on each update. It's efficient and mostly transparent, but make sure to read the serialization section.

# Serialization

Sometimes you want to serialize your application to local storage. 

To save our application with each update, we set the app `autosave` property on the app's `storage` object to `true`:

```typescript
app.storage.autosave = true
```
This will save your serialized component tree in local storage with the container id you specified (e.g `"app"`).

To turn `autosave` off and clear your application state from local storage:
```typescript
app.storage.autosave = false
app.storage.clear()
```

## Property Serialization

It's critical to be aware that **Typescript transpiles away property types** (unlike in C# or Java). The `@Type` decorator of the `class-transformer` serialization package can be used to ensure nested components deserialize with the correct types:

```typescript
export class Composition extends Component
{
    @Type (() => Counter) counter1: Counter
    @Type (() => Counter) counter2: Counter
}
```
As a shortcut, you can also call `initDecorators` in your constructor. This will automatically add `@Type` decorators by scanning for non-undefined instance properties (and do so recursively):

```typescript
export class Composition extends Component
{
    counter1 = new Counter ()
    counter2 = new Counter ()

    constructor() {
        super()
        this.initDecorators()
    }
}
```
You must always apply the `@Type` annotation to arrays of components (do **not** include the `[]`):

```typescript
export class ItemList extends Component
{
   @Type (() => Item) myList: Item[] = []   
}
```
## Circular references

Avoid circular references unless you absolutely need them. Firstly, the serializer doesn't handle them, and secondly, it increases your cyclomatic complexity which is why some languages like F# deliberately force you to minimize them. However, occassionaly you'll need them. To do so:

* override component's `attached` method to set the circular references there
* exclude the circular references from being serialized with the `@transient` decorator

## Keep your component state small

As a general rule, don't gratuitously use component state, and instead try to use pure functions where you can. In particular, avoid storing UI styles in component state - instead pass styles from a parent view down to child views. If you must store a UI style in a component, you'll probably want to decorate it with `@transient` to avoid serialization.

Serialization, deserialization, and local storage are surpisingly fast. However, efficiency is still important. Avoid properties with large immutable objects, and instead indirectly reference them with a key. For example, instead of directly storing a localisation table of French data on your component, you'd merely store the string "fr", and return the localisation table based on that key. Minimize the state on your components to that which you need to respond to user actions; keep it as close to a state machine as possible.

# Hot Module Reloading

When your application state is serialized, an ordinary page refresh will run your modified code with your previous state. We can automatically trigger a page refresh by listening to server code changes:

```
module.hot.accept('../app/samples', () => {
    var latest = require ('../app/samples')
    window["app"] = new App (latest.Samples.prototype.constructor, "app", {isVdomRendered: true})
})
```
The `isVdomRendered` parameter tells the new app instance that there's already a rendered tree, so do a patch rather than create the DOM from scratch.

# Async

Solenya's update path is synchronous, so you perform aynchronous activites outside of update. Suppose a button invokes your submit event handler that calls a web service. That could be defined as follows: 

```typescript
    async submit () {
        var result = await fetch(url)
        if (result.ok) {
            this.update (() => ...)
        }
    }
```
[Play](https://stackblitz.com/edit/solenya-samples?file=app%2FgitSearch.ts)

Notice that the `update` occurs *after* the asynchronous operation has completed.

Both the `Validator` and `Router`, covered in their own sections, are designed to operate asynchronously.

The samples demonstrate calling github's search, with debouncing.

# Data Properties

## Data Keys

It's common for your components to have a mixture of properties representing your domain model, such as `firstName` or `phone`, and properties representing infrastructure, such as `validator` or `router`. You can programmatically get just the domain properties by calling a component's `dataKeys` property, which ignores all properties decorated with `@transient`:

```typescript
class Animal extends Component
{
    @transient router?: Router = undefined
    @transient validator?: Validator = undefined
    species = ""
    caloriesPerDay = NaN

    view() {    
        return div (this.dataKeys().join (",")) // species,caloriesPerDay
    }
}
```
You can think of `dataKeys` like `Object.getKeys`, but for data.

The `Component` class's properties such as `app` and `parent` are decorated as `@transient`.

`@transient` will automatically also decorate your property with `class-transformers`'s `@Exclude()` decorator, so that such properties don't partake in serialization.

## Data Labels

It's common to want display the name of a data property to the user. The `@Label` decorator can be used exactly for this purpose:

```typescript
class Animal extends Component
{
    @Label("Species") name = "Elephant"
    caloriesPerDay = 70000

    // prints:
    // Species: Elephant
    // Calories Per Day: 70000
    view() {    
        return div (
            this.dataKeys().map (k =>
                div (printProp (this, k))
            )            
    }
}

const printProp<T> (obj: any, prop: PropertyRef<T>) =>
    getFriendlyName (obj, prop) + ": " + getPropertyValue (obj, prop))
```
`getFriendlyName` checks to see if there's a `@Label`, and if not, falls back to calling `humanizeIdentifier` on the property name. This means that by default, your users will see `Calories Per Day` instead of `caloriesPerDay` or `calories-per-day`.

The validation sample referred to earlier shows how to hook up validation to use `@Label`.

# API Reference

The `Component` and `App` APIs have been covered in earlier sections, and can also be understood through intellisense and the source code, but are included here to give a reference-oriented overview.

The HTML, lifecycle, serialization, and time travel APIs have already been covered in their dedicated sections.

## Component Class API

### Component View Members

```typescript
/** Override to return a virtual DOM element that visually represents the component's state */
view(): VElement

/** Call to run an action after the view is rendered. Think of it like setTimeout but executed at exactly at the right time in the update cycle. */
onRefreshed (action: () => void) 
```

### Component Initialization Members

```typescript
/** Called after construction, with a flag indicating if deserialization occured */
attached (deserialized: boolean) 

/** Attaches a component to the component tree.
 * Called automatically on refresh but can be explicitly called to eagerly attach.
 */
attach (app: App, parent?: Component)
```
### Component Update Members

```typescript
/** Call with action that updates the component's state, with optional payload */
update (updater: () => void, payload: any = {}) 

/** Override to listen to an update after its occured
* @param payload Contains data associated with update - the update method will set the source property to 'this'
*/
updated (payload: any) : void

/** A convenient shortcut to update a component property; wraps property change in update */
updateProperty (payload: KeyValue)
```

### Component Tree Members

```typescript
/** The app associated with the component; undefined if not yet attached - use judiciously - main purpose is internal use by update method */
app?: App

/** The parent component; undefined if the root component - use judiciously - main purpose is internal use by update method */
parent?: Component  

/** Returns the root component by recursively walking through each parent */
root () : Component 

/** Returns the branch, inclusively from this component to the root component */
branch () : Component[]

/** Returns the properties that are components, flattening out array properties of components */
children () : Component[]      
```
## App Class API

### App Initialization Members
```typescript
/**    
 * The entry point for a solenya app
 * @param rootComponentConstructor The parameterless constructor of the root component
 * @param containerId The element id to render the view, and local storage name
 * @param rootComponent Optionally, an existing instance of the root component
 * @param isVdomRendered Optionally, indicate that the vdom is already rendered
 */
constructor (
    rootComponentConstructor : new() => Component,
    containerId: string,
    rootComponent?: Component,
    isVdomRendered = false
)

/** Root component of updates, view and serialization */
rootComponent: Component 
```

### App Serialization Members
```typescript
/** Manages serialization of root component to local storage */

/** whether snapshots occur by default after each update */
timeTravelOn: boolean 

/**

 * @param doSave true = force save, false = do not save, undefined = use value of App.storage.autosave
 * @param doTimeSnapshot true = force snapshot,false = do not snapshot, undefined = use value of App.timeTravelOn
 */
snapshot(doSave?: boolean, doTimeSnapshot?: boolean): void
```
